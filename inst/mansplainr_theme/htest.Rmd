```{r}
if (x$p.value < .05) {
  stmt <- paste("Wow, a significant result!",
                "And on your first ever hypothesis test!",
                "(I'm assuming.)")
} else {
  stmt <- paste("That means it's not significant at alpha = .05, but that's OK.",
                "The important thing is that you tried.")
}
```

That's great that you were able to do a hypothesis test. You got a p-value of `r format.pval(x$p.value)`. `r stmt`
